# outputs the name of the student who got the highest GWA (including the GWA).

# variable to read binary file
# placeholder variable for storing the current highest GWA
# placeholder variable for the name and gwa of student with highest gwa
# for index [2:7] in binary file
# convert to int
# if placeholder > index then replace placeholder with index
# print highest gwa with the name of the student
